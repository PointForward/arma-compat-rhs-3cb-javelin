# What is this about
Compatibility mod for Arma 3 - makes 3CB BAF Javelin launcher effective against RHS tanks.

# How is it done
Simply by replacing 3CB BAF Javelin missile's penetrator with penetrator used in RHS Javelin. This is done by referencing a class name of said penetrator, therefore user needs to have RHS loaded, otherwise errors will occur (not to mention that the mod is solving an issue involving RHS armoured vehicles in the first place).
Same goes for the Javelin itself - the mod only overrides few lines in config of the Javelin, therefore user has to load 3CB BAF Weapons.
